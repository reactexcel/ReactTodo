# React To Do

* Simple src/index.jsx and src/index.css (local module css).
* Webpack configuration for development (with hot reloading) and production (with minification).
* CSS module loading, so you can include your css by ```import styles from './path/to.css';```.
* Both js(x) and css hot loaded during development.

```
> $ git clone THIS_REPO_URL
```

* Then install the dependencies:

```
> $ npm install
```

* Run development server:

```
> $ npm start
```

Open the web browser to `http://localhost:8888/`

### To build production package

```
> $ npm run build
```

### Eslint
There is a .eslint.yaml config for eslint ready with React plugin.
To use it, you need to install additional dependencies though:

```
> npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-react
```

To do the actual linting, run:

```
> npm run lint
```

### Notes on importing css styles
* styles having /src/ in their absolute path are considered part of the application and exported as local css modules.
* styles having /node_modules|global/ in their absolute path are considered global styles used by many components and are included in the css bundle directly.

### Contribute
Please contribute to the project if you think this can be done better in anyway even for this README :)
